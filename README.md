# sflib96
These are the 96k/24-bit samples that were part of the historical "sflib" from the Eastman Computer Music Center (now [EARS](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/ears/)), a collection of instrumental sound samples collected by former director Allan Schindler. The 44.1k/16-bit sflib can be found [here](https://github.com/scottericpetersen/sflib).
